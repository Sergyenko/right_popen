# RightScale.popen3 allows running external processes aynchronously
# while still capturing their standard and error outputs.
# It relies on EventMachine for most of its internal mechanisms.

module RightScale

  # Spawn process to run given command asynchronously, hooking all three
  # standard streams of the child process.
  #
  # Streams the command's stdout and stderr to the given handlers. Time-
  # ordering of bytes sent to stdout and stderr is not preserved.
  #
  # Calls given exit handler upon command process termination, passing in the
  # resulting Process::Status.
  #
  # All handlers must be methods exposed by the given target.
  #
  # === Parameters
  # options[:command](String or Array):: Command to execute, including any arguments as a single string or an array of command and arguments
  # options[:environment](Hash):: Hash of environment variables values keyed by name
  # options[:input](String):: Input string that will get streamed into child's process stdin
  # options[:target](Object):: object defining handler methods to be called, optional (no handlers can be defined if not specified)
  # options[:pid_handler](String):: PID notification handler method name, optional
  # options[:stdout_handler](String):: Stdout handler method name, optional
  # options[:stderr_handler](String):: Stderr handler method name, optional
  # options[:exit_handler](String):: Exit handler method name, optional
  #
  # === Returns
  # true:: always true
